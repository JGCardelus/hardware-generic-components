# hardware-generic-components
This folder contains generic hardware components defined in VHDL (prepared for QUARTUS). As they are constantly reused, I might be simpler to have them all together so that is easier to find and use them. There is also a program that allows to bulk copy and setup the components in Quartus' projects to avoid the hassle of doing that manually.
